As companies work to rebuild global supply chains, PSA examines the case of e.l.f. Cosmetics, Inc. and its fine for sanctions violations. The DOJ found that these violations occurred because of a “largely inadequate” compliance program. The individual unit cost of the items were low, &nbsp;and only limited elements of each unit sold were ultimately sourced from DPRK. However this was enough for regulatory action. A timely and cautionary reminder as we all continue to adapt to disruptive and world changing events at speed.

PSA has prepared a brief exploring the implications of this case and describing the importance of a robust supply chain due diligence program that covers not only a company’s suppliers, but also those suppliers’ own affiliates and business partners.
