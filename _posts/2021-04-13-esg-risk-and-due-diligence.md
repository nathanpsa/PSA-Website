Originally a tool for investors, ESG is increasingly used by other corporate stakeholders to evaluate risks associated with sustainability, human rights, and governance among business partners. In this episode,&nbsp;[**Sarah Carpenter**](https://www.assentcompliance.com/about-compliance-experts/)&nbsp;of Assent Compliance talks with PSAâ€™s Michael Olver about how ESG can be leveraged by risk management programs to achieve a comprehensive view of sometimes hidden risks. Sarah and Michael discuss how ESG issues can be incorporated into due diligence efforts and Sarah shares insights derived from her deep experience in business and human rights issues about the prevalence of modern slavery and other forms of forced labor in value chains.
