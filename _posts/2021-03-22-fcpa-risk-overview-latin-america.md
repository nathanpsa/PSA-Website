Latin American countries have presented significant FCPA risks in recent years. Of the 82 FCPA cases settled in the last five years, 31 have involved the top five Latin American economies:&nbsp;**Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,&nbsp;**and&nbsp;**Mexico**.&nbsp; PSAâ€™s new regional FCPA Risk Overview provides a data-driven survey of corruption risks and FCPA enforcement activity in these five countries.

The overview provides key governance performance indicators, breaks down regional FCPA enforcement trends, and details the distribution of state-owned enterprises in each country. Our FCPA Risk Map charts the patterns of corruption subject to FCPA enforcement, linking high-risk sectors with the types of foreign officials in each country involved in soliciting bribes.
