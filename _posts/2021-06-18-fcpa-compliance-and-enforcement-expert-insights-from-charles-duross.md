In this episode of the Better Intelligence Podcast, PSA’s Michael Olver speaks with [**Charles Duross**](https://www.mofo.com/people/charles-duross.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, who spent seven years at the DOJ’s FCPA unit before entering private practice to counsel clients on FCPA matters. Charles, whom the *Washington Post* has dubbed “Mr. FCPA,” provides Michael and guest co-host **[Katayune Ehsani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katayune-ehsani-080ab380/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** unparalleled insights into how the DOJ and SEC pursue investigations, how to manage internal and government-facing investigations, and how to establish priorities in a compliance program. The conversation provides invaluable insights into ever-evolving corruption schemes, compliance program blind spots, and other critical areas of FCPA risk.
