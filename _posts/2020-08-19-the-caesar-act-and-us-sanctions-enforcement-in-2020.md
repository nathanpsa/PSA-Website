The United Statesâ€™ Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act came into force in June, expanding the existing sanctions regime against the Assad regime. The legislation highlights oil and gas and construction sectors as potential targets and opens the door to expanded sanctions on third country nationals engaging with Damascus. PSA CEO Michael Olver spoke with Andrew Jacobson of Seward & Kissel LLP to learn more about the implications of this act and how it fits into existing sanctions enforcement practices. Andrew and Michael discuss the growing reach of sanctions enforcement indicated by the act as well as appropriate due diligence responses to mitigate the risks of inadvertent violations. All along Andrew provides valuable insights into US sanctions enforcement and the sometimes unexpected risks sanctioned entities present to businesses worldwide.
