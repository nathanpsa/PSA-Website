The terrible events in Ukraine over the past three weeks have led to what today’s guest has called “the most significant implementation of sanctions that has ever occurred.”&nbsp; These sanctions are fast moving, multilateral, and create a complex web of individual overlapping regimes which cut deep into the Russian economy. &nbsp;**[Andrew Jacobson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsonandrew/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** from Seward & Kissel LLP, helps us frame the events, the context, and how in-house legal, compliance and operations can begin to assess the potential impact of these new regulations.&nbsp; In this episode, Michael provides a background on Russian sanctions from 2014 to date before the discussion moves on to the mechanisms of these new regulations. They also discuss the potential this may have on separate sanctions on oil producing Iran and Venezuela as energy prices continue to rise as part of this dynamic series of events, and provide advice on how to frame the approach to assessing exposure.&nbsp;
