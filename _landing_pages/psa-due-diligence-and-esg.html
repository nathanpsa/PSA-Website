      ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are fast becoming a
      key part of the regulatory landscape. ESG metrics are becoming more
      standardized and applied in a variety of contexts by different
      stakeholders to measure the sustainability and social responsibility
      impacts of businesses. In the coming years, US, EU, and other authorities
      will increasingly prescribe due diligence or disclosure requirements meant
      to address ESG issues in value chains.

          <p><strong>For integrated risk and compliance
          programs</strong></p><p>Companies face increasing pressure to
          integrate a variety of risk management programs under one roof. As
          this process continues we anticipate that it will become essential for
          ESG and other concerns to be integrated into due diligence programs
          already in place to assess other risks. PSA&rsquo;s in-program
          services, built around Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) reporting, can
          provide crossover solutions to identify and understand risks among the
          broadening spectrum of issues falling within the scope of integrated
          risk management programs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
