      Recent global events have created an environment potentially rich in
      acquisition and investment opportunities for cash rich businesses. However
      even within the more regulated markets, risks exist below the radar and
      outside the scope of the standard pre-acquisition financial and legal due
      diligence. Business practices that are key to sustaining to the balance
      sheets of a soon to be acquired mid-sized local or regional entity may be
      unclear during acquisition, and at worst such practices may be dangerous
      to fatal for a buyer with a more international regulatory nexus.  Such
      local practices may involve leveraging off key multi-generational family
      or community relationships for operating licenses. They may extend to
      questionable import and export processes and partners, creative taxation
      disclosures, and to outright corrupt practices to win contracts or to be
      paid for projects. However almost none of these elements would be detected
      within the scope of a standard financial and legal due diligence process. 
      To make matters worse the patterns of these concerns differ dramatically
      by region, industry and even within industry verticals. Deep local
      knowledge is required to know what to look for, with even deeper reach
      being required to discreetly be able to identify the nature and extent of
      a potential risk.

      For over 20 years PSA has supported multinational companies in local
      acquisitions. During this process we regularly identify deeply ingrained
      cultures of corruption, or other questionable practices within a local
      company and its management, that while sustaining to its financial health,
      are untenable to its new multinational buyer.  Leveraging off yeas of
      experience, capable in house teams, and deep local networks PSA comes to
      each opportunity with a unique methodology tailored to identify the most
      prominent, highest potential impact and most likely risk within that local
      environment, and supports the process with the ability to discreetly
      collect critical information to support the clients determination.

      In addition to our pre-acquisition experience, PSA has a substantial and
      ongoing track record of supporting financial institutions with large-scale
      pre transactional work. The pre-transactional team routinely conducts
      pre-IPO and other transactional due diligence aimed at identifying a range
      of off-balance sheet regulatory, ESG, and reputational risk.

      3rd party vendors, agents, and suppliers generate a range of risk for an
      organization, including corruption, bribery, sanctions violations,
      regulatory exposure, and operational risk. Jurisdictions with the greatest
      opportunity for growth are often the most opaque suffering from weak
      domestic regulatory and governance programs and affording limited
      visibility from a company’s operational center. Compounding these concerns
      most companies have thousands of third parties operating across multiple
      areas requiring specialist language and local knowledge to effectively
      monitor and review .

      SAAS based Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) platforms combined with
      screening 3rd party screening tools are a critical component in the fight
      to manage 3rd party risk.  However, screening and monitoring can only go
      so far. In over 92% of instances in which PSA has identified a significant
      risk during 3P diligence, no issues of concern were first identified from
      reports done by the leading global regulatory screening tools.  Informed
      Human Analysis must be the essential next step in your risk-based approach
      when identifying and remediating risk. However with hundreds or thousands
      of vendors, going outside of your platform environment to obtain this
      additional necessary element, and then bringing the findings back into the
      system can be overwhelmingly labor intensive.

      As stakeholders increasingly demand sustainability and social
      responsibility, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are
      fast becoming a key part of public disclosure. In the coming years, US,
      EU, and other authorities will increasingly prescribe due diligence or
      disclosure requirements meant to address ESG issues in value chains.
      Companies face increasing pressure to integrate ESG concerns and other
      risk management programs under one roof however there are few solutions
      available to explore and capture this risk that are beyond static national
      level or aggregated climate data but before a comprehensive and often
      deeply invasive audit by a specialist consultancy.
